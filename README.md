Library Management Project

The project utilizes the use of React and Node.js, as well as the libraries Node.js offers, to create a library management system that is user-friendly and minimal to simplify managing library books, memberships, and students. Using the MongoDB database to track the necessary data, it is connected and manipulated through Node.js in regards to the different modifications a librarian can perform within the website.
